## 1. What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering is the process of designing, testing, and refining the inputs (prompts) given to LLMs to achieve desired outputs. It involves understanding model behavior, business context, and compliance requirements.

---

## 2. Principles of Effective Prompt Design
- **Clarity**: Use explicit, unambiguous language.
- **Context**: Provide relevant background or instructions.
- **Specificity**: Ask for the exact information or action needed.
- **Consistency**: Use standardized templates for recurring tasks.
- **Safety**: Avoid prompts that could elicit sensitive or non-compliant responses.

---

## 3. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them
- **Ambiguity**: Leads to unpredictable outputs. Use clear instructions.
- **Overly Broad Prompts**: Narrow the scope to avoid irrelevant or excessive information.
- **Prompt Injection**: Sanitize user inputs and use templates to prevent manipulation.
- **Lack of Testing**: Always test prompts with edge cases and real data.

---

## 4. Prompt Security and Compliance
- **Input Validation**: Check prompts for prohibited content or sensitive data.
- **Policy Enforcement**: Use Mindria’s policy engine to block or modify unsafe prompts.
- **Audit Logging**: Log all prompts and responses for compliance and troubleshooting.

---

## 5. Tools for Prompt Engineering
- **Mindria Prompt Tester**: Interactive tool for testing and refining prompts.
- **Prompt Versioning System**: Track changes and performance of prompts over time.
- **Automated Evaluation**: Use scripts to benchmark prompt effectiveness.

---

## 6. Versioning and Testing Prompts
- **Version Control**: Store prompts in Git or Mindria’s prompt management system.
- **A/B Testing**: Compare prompt variants to optimize performance.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure updates do not introduce new issues.

---

## 7. Advanced Techniques
- **Chain-of-Thought Prompts**: Guide the model through step-by-step reasoning.
- **Few-Shot Learning**: Provide examples to improve output quality.
- **Dynamic Prompting**: Generate prompts programmatically based on user context.
- **Multi-Query Expansion**: Use multiple prompts to cover complex queries.

---

## 8. Real-World Examples
### Example 1: Compliance Summary
Prompt: "Summarize this document for a compliance officer, highlighting any GDPR risks."

### Example 2: Sensitive Data Detection
Prompt: "Detect and redact any personally identifiable information in the following text."

### Example 3: Customer Support
Prompt: "Provide a concise answer to the customer’s question, referencing our knowledge base."

---

## 9. Collaboration and Review
- **Peer Review**: All new prompts should be reviewed by a second engineer or compliance officer.
- **Documentation**: Maintain a prompt library with usage notes and performance metrics.
- **Feedback Loops**: Collect feedback from users and update prompts regularly.
