# Mindria LLM Security Platform: Incident Response Plan

## Introduction
The Mindria LLM Security Platform is designed to provide robust security and compliance for organizations deploying large language models (LLMs). However, no system is immune to incidents. This Incident Response Plan (IRP) outlines the procedures, roles, and best practices for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents involving LLMs and related infrastructure.

## 1. Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this IRP is to ensure a coordinated, effective, and timely response to security incidents that may impact Mindriaâ€™s LLM platform, customer data, or business operations. The plan covers:
- Data leakage or exposure
- Unauthorized access or privilege escalation
- Model misuse or prompt injection
- Service disruption (DoS/DDoS)
- Insider threats
- Third-party breaches

---

## 2. Incident Types and Definitions
- **Data Leakage**: Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or regulated data.
- **Unauthorized Access**: Access by an unapproved user or process.
- **Model Misuse**: Use of the LLM for prohibited or malicious purposes.
- **Prompt Injection**: Manipulation of LLM prompts to bypass controls.
- **Service Disruption**: Outages or performance degradation due to attacks or failures.
- **Insider Threat**: Malicious or negligent actions by employees or contractors.

---

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities
- **Incident Commander**: Leads the response, coordinates teams, and makes critical decisions.
- **Security Analyst**: Investigates, documents, and analyzes incidents.
- **Communications Lead**: Manages internal and external communications.
- **Forensics Specialist**: Collects and preserves evidence.
- **IT Support**: Restores systems and implements mitigations.
- **Legal/Compliance**: Advises on regulatory and contractual obligations.

---

## 4. Incident Response Lifecycle
Mindria follows the NIST 800-61 framework:
1. **Preparation**: Training, tools, and policies in place.
2. **Detection & Analysis**: Identify and assess incidents using monitoring tools, SIEM, and user reports.
3. **Containment**: Limit the scope and impact (e.g., isolate affected systems, revoke credentials).
4. **Eradication**: Remove the root cause (e.g., patch vulnerabilities, remove malware).
5. **Recovery**: Restore services and validate integrity.
6. **Post-Incident Review**: Document lessons learned and update policies.

---

## 5. Communication and Escalation
- **Internal Channels**: Slack #incidents, email, phone tree.
- **External Notifications**: Customers, regulators, law enforcement as required.
- **Incident Severity Levels**: Defined from SEV-1 (critical) to SEV-4 (minor).
- **Escalation Matrix**: Outlines who to contact at each severity level.

---

## 6. Forensics and Evidence Handling
- Preserve logs, memory dumps, and disk images.
- Chain of custody documentation for all evidence.
- Use approved forensic tools and procedures.
- Coordinate with legal and compliance teams.

---

## 7. Post-Incident Review and Reporting
- Conduct a root cause analysis.
- Document timeline, actions taken, and outcomes.
- Share findings with stakeholders.
- Update incident response playbooks.
- File regulatory reports if required (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

---

## 8. Training and Drills
- Quarterly tabletop exercises for all response team members.
- Annual full-scale incident simulation.
- Ongoing training on new threats and response techniques.

---

## 9. Tools and Resources
- SIEM platform for monitoring and alerting.
- Ticketing system for incident tracking.
- Secure communication channels.
- Forensic analysis tools.
- Incident response checklists and runbooks.

---

## 10. Continuous Improvement
- Review and update the IRP annually or after major incidents.
- Solicit feedback from responders and stakeholders.
- Track metrics (MTTD, MTTR, number of incidents) to measure effectiveness.
