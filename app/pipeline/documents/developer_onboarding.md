## 1. Getting Started
- **Access**: You will receive invites to GitHub, Slack, and the Mindria Admin Dashboard.
- **First Steps**: Complete your HR onboarding, set up your accounts, and review the company handbook.
- **Mentorship**: You will be assigned a mentor for your first 90 days.

---

## 2. Development Environment Setup
- **Clone the Repository**: `git clone git@github.com:mindria/llm-security-platform.git`
- **Python Environment**: Use Python 3.10+ and create a virtual environment.
- **Dependencies**: Install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Environment Variables**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your API keys.
- **Docker**: Install Docker Desktop for local development and testing.
- **IDE**: VS Code is recommended, with the Python and Docker extensions.

---

## 3. Code Standards and Best Practices
- **Formatting**: Use Black for Python code formatting.
- **Linting**: Run Flake8 before every commit.
- **Type Checking**: Use MyPy for static type checks.
- **Documentation**: All public functions and classes must have docstrings.
- **Pull Requests**: All changes require a PR and at least one code review.

---

## 4. Version Control and Branching
- **Main Branches**: `main` (production), `develop` (integration).
- **Feature Branches**: Use `feature/<your-feature>` naming.
- **Commit Messages**: Follow Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat: add audit logging`).
- **Merging**: Use squash merges for features, rebase for hotfixes.

---

## 5. Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Unit Tests**: Required for all new features (pytest).
- **Integration Tests**: For end-to-end workflows.
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 90% coverage enforced in CI.
- **Manual QA**: Performed before major releases.

---

## 6. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- **CI**: GitHub Actions run tests, linting, and type checks on every PR.
- **CD**: Deployments to staging and production are automated via GitHub Actions and Docker.
- **Secrets Management**: Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data.

---

## 7. Security and Compliance in Development
- **Secure Coding**: Follow OWASP Top 10 and Mindriaâ€™s secure coding guidelines.
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated scans for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- **Code Reviews**: Security and compliance are part of every review.
- **Data Handling**: Never commit secrets or production data.

---

## 8. Documentation and Knowledge Sharing
- **Confluence**: Main hub for engineering documentation.
- **README.md**: Every repo and major module must have an up-to-date README.
- **Wiki**: Use the Engineering Wiki for tips, FAQs, and onboarding notes.
- **Lunch & Learn**: Biweekly sessions to share knowledge and demos.

---

## 9. Support and Resources
- **#dev-support**: Slack channel for engineering help.
- **Jira**: For tracking tasks, bugs, and sprints.
- **IT Support**: it@mindria.com for hardware and access issues.
- **Engineering Manager**: Your first point of contact for questions.

---

## 10. Growth and Learning Opportunities
- **Learning Stipend**: Annual budget for courses, books, and conferences.
- **Mentorship**: Ongoing peer and senior mentorship.
- **Certifications**: Support for relevant certifications (e.g., security, cloud).
- **Career Pathways**: Clear tracks for technical and leadership growth.
